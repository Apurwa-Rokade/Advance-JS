// In JavaScript, the comma operator allows you to evaluate multiple expressions, returning the value 
// of the last expression. It's represented by a comma (,).

// Its syntax is simple:
// expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN

// Here's an example:

let a = (2 + 2, 3 + 3, 4 + 4);

console.log(a); // Output: 8



// In this case:

// The expressions 2 + 2, 3 + 3, and 4 + 4 are separated by commas.
// However, only the last expression, 4 + 4, determines the value assigned to a.
// So, despite evaluating multiple expressions, only the result of the last one, 8,is assigned to the
//  variable a.
// The comma operator is handy in situations where you want to execute multiple expressions but only
//  care about the result of the last one.
