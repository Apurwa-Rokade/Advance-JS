Importance of Meta tag:
1) Improve SEO: Meta tags, especially the meta title and description, help search engines understand 
and index webpage content more accurately. This can lead to better rankings and visibility in search 
engine results pages (SERPs).

2)Enhanced Click-Through Rates (CTR): A well-crafted meta description can attract users by providing 
a concise preview of the webpage content. When users see relevant and engaging meta descriptions, 
they're more likely to click on the link, improving the CTR.

3)Clearer Website Information: Meta tags provide additional information about a webpage's content,
purpose, and relevance. They offer a snapshot of what users can expect, helping them decide whether
to visit the site.

4)Better User Experience: Clear and descriptive meta tags contribute to a positive user experience. 
Users can quickly determine if a webpage meets their needs based on the information provided in the
meta description and title.

5)Look Good on Social Media: Some meta tags control how your webpage looks when shared on platforms
like Facebook or Twitter, making it more appealing.

6)Stand Out from Others: Well-written meta tags can make your webpage seem different and more attractive
 compared to others in search results.
