<!-- A favicon is a small icon associated with a website, typically displayed in the browser's
address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes in search results. It helps users visually identify 
and distinguish one website from another.

Here's an illustrative example of how a favicon is implemented in HTML: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Website with Favicon</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- Explanation:

The <link> tag within the <head> section associates the website with its favicon.
rel="icon" indicates that this is a link to an icon.
href="favicon.ico" specifies the file path or URL where the favicon image (in .ico format) is located.
type="image/x-icon" specifies the MIME type of the favicon image. -->
