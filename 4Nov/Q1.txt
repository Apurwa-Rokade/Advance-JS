Operators in JavaScript, as in other programming languages, are symbols or keywords used to perform 
operations on operands. These operands can be variables, values, or expressions. 
They are essential in programming for several reasons and they belows:

1) Performing Operations: Operators allow programmers to perform arithmetic operations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. They also enable logical operations such as AND, OR, 
and NOT, as well as comparison operations like equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, etc.

2)Manipulating Values: JavaScript operators can concatenate strings, modify variable values using 
assignment operators, increment or decrement values, and more. For example, the + operator can
concatenate strings: "Hello" + " " + "World" results in "Hello World".

3)Control Flow: Operators play a crucial role in control flow statements like conditional statements 
(using comparison and logical operators) and loops. These operators determine when certain blocks of 
code should execute based on conditions.

4)Assignment: Assignment operators (=, +=, -=) are used to assign values to variables. They're
 fundamental in storing and updating data within a program.
