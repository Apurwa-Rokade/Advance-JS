// Unary Operators: Unary operators are those that work on a single operand, i.e., they perform an 
// operation on one variable or value.

//unary minus(-):
let num = 10;
let negatedNum = -num; // Unary minus
// negatedNum will be -10

//unary plus(+)
let str = "5";
let convertedNum = +str; // Unary plus
// convertedNum will be 5 (as a number)

//logical not(!)
let isTrue = true;
let inverted = !isTrue; // Logical NOT
// inverted will be false


//Binary Operators: Binary operators work on two operands, performing an operation between them.
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b; // Binary addition
// sum will be 8
let x = 4;
let y = 6;
let product = x * y; // Binary multiplication
// product will be 24


//Ternary Operator: The only ternary operator in JavaScript is the conditional (ternary) operator ?:,
//  which takes three operands. It's a shorthand for an if-else statement.

// Example:

let age = 20;
let allowed = (age >= 18) ? 'Allowed' : 'Not Allowed'; // Ternary conditional operator
// If age is greater than or equal to 18, allowed will be 'Allowed', otherwise 'Not Allowed'
